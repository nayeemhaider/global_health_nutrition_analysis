# Country Stories

This folder can store short narrative summaries and figures for individual countries.

Example structure:

• `Bangladesh.md`  
• `Germany.md`  
• `Brazil.md`  

Each file can include:

• A short description of how life expectancy and child mortality changed  
• A summary of changes in healthcare access and basic services  
• A brief description of noticeable trends in diet and cardiovascular health  
• One or two key visualisations exported from the notebooks or dashboard

These stories can be generated manually or semi-automatically from the `get_country_story` query used in the Streamlit app.
